# 🔐 Secure Data Vault – Streamlit App

A user-friendly encryption system built using **Python, Streamlit**, and **Fernet encryption** to securely store and retrieve sensitive data. This app includes authentication, password hashing, encrypted storage, admin dashboard, and beautiful UI.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔑 **User Authentication (Register / Login / Logout)**
- 🧠 **Password Hashing using `hashlib` (SHA-256)**
- 🔐 **Fernet Symmetric Encryption** (from `cryptography`)
- 📂 **Store Sensitive Data** using a custom passkey
- 🔍 **Retrieve Data** with decryption and failed attempt lock
- 📋 **User Dashboard** to view and manage stored entries
- 🧹 **Clear Individual Data** or perform **Admin Master Reset**
- 🗂️ **Import / Export JSON Data**
- 🎨 Custom UI with images, sidebar tools, and page backgrounds

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🔑 Password Security

- User passwords are **hashed using SHA-256** before saving (no plain text).
- Users are authenticated based on stored hash.

### 🛡️ Encryption System

- Uses **Fernet symmetric encryption** to encrypt user text.
- The encryption key is stored in `secret.key` and loaded at runtime.

### 🔒 Access Control

- 3 failed attempts to decrypt data locks the user out (requires re-login).
- Only logged-in users can store/retrieve data.
- Admin-only access to global data reset and viewing all records.
